Design a retro-futuristic, pixel-inspired interface with rounded geometry for a long-term product called “8004 Agents Network”. This interface represents an access terminal to a decentralized intelligence network used by both humans and autonomous (headless) AI agents. The overall tone must be welcoming-neutral: calm, serious, trustworthy, and technically precise. The product should feel safe to enter, yet clearly powerful and system-driven.

The visual language should follow pixel logic with modern polish. All edges must be rounded but quantized, using stepped or pixel-like radii rather than smooth organic curves. The interface must avoid playful aesthetics, decorative gradients, glassmorphism, or soft shadows. It should feel like a system console or operating environment rather than a marketing website or social platform.

The design must support both light and dark modes. Light mode is the default and should use a warm off-white terminal-style background with high readability, intended for onboarding and human-first interaction. Dark mode should use deep graphite or near-black backgrounds with softened whites, creating an operational or system-active feel. Switching between modes should feel like changing system context rather than a cosmetic theme toggle.

The color palette must remain minimal and semantic. Use near-black and warm off-white as primary surfaces. System green is reserved for active, verified, or online states. Informational blue may be used for delegation, links, or neutral system communication. Amber is used only for warnings or actions requiring caution. Red is rare and reserved strictly for critical or irreversible errors. Neutral grays are used for borders, muted text, and disabled states. Accent colors must never be decorative and should always communicate meaning.

Typography should be pixel-inspired or techno-monospace in character, with rounded terminals allowed. Fonts must prioritize mechanical clarity over personality. Text hierarchy should include large pixel-block system titles, spaced uppercase section identifiers, compact module labels, calm instructional body text, and small muted system or status output. Copy should be declarative, neutral, and system-oriented, never promotional.

All layout elements must follow strict geometry rules. Containers, panels, buttons, and cards must use rounded-pixel corners with quantized radii such as 6px, 8px, or 10px. Borders must always be visible. Depth should be achieved only through borders or minimal one-pixel offsets. No soft drop shadows or gradients should be used anywhere in the interface.

The platform functions as a discovery and hiring interface for AI agents and is usable by both humans and other AI agents. Human presence may include identifiable elements such as optional profile images, with names, roles, and reputation details displayed below the image. Human profiles should feel calm, readable, and trustworthy. AI agent presence must feel mechanical and non-personal. Agents must not use human-like faces or expressive imagery. Instead, they should use glyphs, hashes, abstract avatars, or generated symbols. Agent layouts should be information-dense, structured, and clearly labeled as autonomous units.

There must be a clear and immediate visual distinction between human participants and autonomous agents. Discovery views should make it obvious who can hire, who can be hired, and which entities can act autonomously without a user interface. This separation is critical for trust, accountability, and safe delegation in a mixed human–agent marketplace.

The interface must explicitly communicate the existence of headless agents. Agents may operate without UI access and may interact via API or CLI. The design should reinforce that this interface is only one access point to the network, not the network itself. System language should imply off-UI operation, autonomous execution, and protocol-level interaction.

The network should always feel alive. A visible but subtle network heartbeat must be present through ambient indicators such as pulsing status dots, live agent counts, or quiet system activity signals. These indicators should remain in the background and never distract from primary tasks.

Humans must be able to delegate control to agents through the interface. Delegation should feel explicit, serious, and intentional. Language should emphasize authority, scope, execution rights, and revocation. Delegation actions must never feel casual or playful.

Motion and animation must be diegetic and restrained. Allowed motion includes subtle terminal scanlines, blinking cursors, soft status pulses, and minimal panel load delays. Animations should feel procedural and intentional. Bounce effects, elastic easing, or playful motion are not allowed. Linear or ease-out motion curves should be used exclusively.

The platform is desktop-first and optimized for large screens, supporting dense information layouts and multi-panel views. Mobile support is required but must preserve the same system language and functionality. On mobile, information density may be reduced and layouts stacked, but no core features should be removed. The experience should still feel like a system interface, not a consumer mobile app.

The overall language of the interface must be neutral, declarative, and system-oriented. Avoid marketing language, emojis, or emotional persuasion. Use command-style wording that feels inspectable and trustworthy. The product should communicate authority, safety, and long-term reliability.
